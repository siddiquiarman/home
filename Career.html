		<h2>What is Career Mode?</h2>
		<p>Career mode is a game mode in FIFA 20 where you use a Manager or to create a player and try to acheive success with them and with the team you're playing with. Manager mode has more features than Player Career which is why Manager mode is more popular. You create a manager and choose a team you wish to coach. Once you have chose the team you have to play matches throughout the season and try your best to win trophies depending on what league you play in. You can also buy and sell players for a specifc transfer fee. You also have to train your players in order for them to improve.  
		<h2>What's new in Career Mode?</h2>
		<p>Ea sports have added multiple changes to career mode:
		<li>Press Conferences</li>
		<li>Player Morale</li>
		<li>Customization</li>
		<h2>Press Conferences</h2>
		<p>Whether it's before or after a game a reporter will ask your Manager a specific question you're going to answer. This is the first time Press conferences are in FIFA.</p>

		<p>As you can see you praise, motivate, critisize, sympathize, and calm, all of this affects your job.Press Conferences will represent the main venue where the manager will take questions and answer them, both before important matches but also immediately after. Both the Pre and Post Match Press Conferences will leverage newly-built scenes specifically designed to be part of the Manager Career experience.</p>
		<h2> Player Morale </h2>
		<p>You can now have a 1-on 1 interaction with players within through a messaging app.</p>
		<image src = "images\ramos.png" = alt= "ramos.png" width = "600" height = "350">
		<p> You will be able to choose the way in which you tackle a large variety of situations, and, based on your methods, either positively or negatively influence player morale as well as your rating as a manager.</p>
		<p> The morale on the top right gets affected when you press on what you're going to say. It will affect the players mood and stats.</p>
		<h2>Customization</h2>
		<p>Customization is a key factor in manager mode now. You can customize your manager in many different ways such as hairstyles, hats, different clothes and more.</p>
