	    <h1>EA Sports FIFA 20 New Gamemode Volta Football </h1>
		<h2>What is Volta?</p>
		<p>Volta Football is a brand new game mode in FIFA 20 and is a simultaion of Futsal and Street Soccer. The differece between Fustal and real life Soccer is that Futsal is played indoors and on a floor or concrete instead of grass. You have to utilize your skills an tricks rather than playing as a whole team because you are playing indoors and in a smaller setting. This amazing real life sport is now in the virtual world as Electronic arts have added this in.What you’ll discover with VOLTA FOOTBALL is a simulation experience that is free-flowing, skillful, fun, and competitive, providing unique ways to attack your opponent while at the same time being extremely easy to pick up and play. Imagine a wall pass to yourself where the wall becomes your teammate and with the simple press of a pass button you’re sliding past the opposition for an opportunity on goal. Or a simple flick up and over your opponent’s head to create space on goal. 
		<h2>What are some features in Volta?</h2>

		<h2>Volta Gameplay</li>
		<p>Gameplay has different modes, each with different circumstances and specific rule combinations. Another one of EA sports's core pillars was to create an experience that is easy to pick up, but at the same time has enough depth so players will want to challenge one another and compete at different skill levels.</p>
		<li>Simplified Rules</li>
		<p>In VOLTA FOOTBALL there are no substitutions, offsides, injuries, yellow or red cards, or even fatigue/stamina. This is done in order to create a more accessible, fun and free flowing game.</p>
		<li>Match Types</li>
		<p>Rush Keepers: played in 3v3 and 4v4, Rush is the street mode without Goalkeepers and with small goals, where each player is expected to contribute to all aspects of the game, be it scoring or blocking a shot.</p>
		<p>Street with Keepers: played in 4v4 and 5v5, is the street mode with Goalkeepers and Futsal-sized goals, which combines the safety of a goalkeeper with the bespoke rules and personality of the street.</p>
        <p>Futsal is a 5-a-side experience with more authentic rules, referees, and a more structured type of play. The formations available are the same as 5v5 street with keepers.</p>
		<li>Enviornment</li>
		<p>In FIFA 20 Volta you can choose 17 stadiums you want to play in all around the world, such as in Barcelona, Las vegas, Tokyo, New York and Many more.</p>
